  Andy was recommended by my daughter as he is currently instructing my
  grandson, Andy got me through my test to pass first time in less than 3 weeks,
  I would hasten to add that I have been driving 40 odd years but never sat a
  test he managed to knock 40 years of bad driving habits out of me and have me
  driving to test standard in just a few lessons, I cannot praise his skill and
  ability as an instructor enough, I have no hesitation in recommending Andy to
  anyone, he is an exceptional instructor.


  Thx Andy
