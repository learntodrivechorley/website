content: "Passed first time with Andy, really good instructor and always felt safe when entering his car. He was recommended to me by a friend whilst I was with a different instructor and I'm glad I changed to him. If you were unable to do a lesson in which you'd arranged, he would always try his best to fit you in another time/day. Driving aside he is good to chat to whilst you're driving and is very patient. Cheers again Andy"
