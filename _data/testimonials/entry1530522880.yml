content: "I would highly recommend Andy as a driving instructor. I had never been in a car before and although he was very busy he still made time and gave 100% effort to help me learn how to drive. He was also very patient and made me very relaxed while driving as He was very easy to talk to and is approachable. After my journey with Andy I'm please to say I passed my driving test first time, Andy's the best!"
