  Andy is an incredible instructor who I chose after hearing such good things
  from my friends. I was very nervous and had little confidence, however Andy
  turned that right around and was very patient, he made me feel very
  comfortable and at ease! Andy is such a kind and friendly guy and I looked
  forward to my lessons with him. I cannot recommend him enough. Thankyou Andy!
