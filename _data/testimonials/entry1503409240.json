I had no confidence and I didn't know how to do anything! \r\nThen as soon as I came to Andy I felt like I learned everything in just one lesson! \r\nAbsolutely amazing instructor, very thorough and easy to understand. \r\nHad a great time learning with him and passed first time! Couldn't have asked for a better instructor!\r\n\r\nThank you Andy!!"}
