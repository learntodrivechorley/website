I can now get to work, shop, and meet my friends without having to wait for buses and taxis.  I never thought I'd pass my test , but as the lessons progressed I could feel  my confidence getting better and better, as the lessons went on. Thanks to Lucy recommended you, I may have never passed the test. Its been a pleasure and a joy to learn with you. Thank you x"}
