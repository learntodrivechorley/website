content: "Andy is an excellent driving instructor, and I have already recommended him to my friends. He was very patient with me and helped build my confidence. He made the lessons fun and I looked forward to them every week. I passed first time a few weeks ago and could not have done this without the help of Andy. I am also booked to do some motorway tuition in the next few days. Andy is a great guy and I cannot thank him enough.<br />
