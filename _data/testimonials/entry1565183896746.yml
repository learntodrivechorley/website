  What can I say? Well after waiting to learn to drive in my 40s, Andy was the
  perfect instructor for me.  He taught my niece & friend too. Super positive,
  calm and informative, I can't recommend him enough, after 5 months of weekly
  lessons I passed both my theory and practical 1st time. If your thinking of
  learning to drive.. You need Andy in your corner!! Thanks Andy x
