content: "Thankyou Andy for getting me through my test. I have been learning to drive on and off for years and then I met you and passed my test within a couple of months. You have this way of teaching that sticks in the mind making it easy to remember everything your supposed to be doing when driving. My confidence in driving has grown massively over the past few months and I feel confident now to drive alone all thanks to you. Top class service would definitely recommend to everyone. <br />
Thankyou for everything"
