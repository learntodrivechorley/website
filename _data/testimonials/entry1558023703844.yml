  Andy came recommended to me by a friend who had used him in the past. I can't
  put into words how good of an instructor he is. After only 3 lessons who told
  me to put in for my theory which I passed first time, and then I had my test
  on the 15th May 2019 which I also passed first time. He is calm, patient,
  friendly talks to you as an adult, and a very very exceptional instructor. I
  would highly recommend Andy to anyone else. Thank you so so much for
  everything, couldn't of done it without you!!!!
