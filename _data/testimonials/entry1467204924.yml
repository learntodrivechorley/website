content: "I actually passed with Andy in October 2015 but didn't realise you could write a testimonial so freely! I was recommended Andy by a friend of mine and I always recommend him. He's light hearted, funny and very professional making learning to drive so much easier as you don't feel judged. I was a nervous driver in the beginning but quickly became confident. He's also very flexible - working for an agency at the time he picked me up for driving after work regularly (various spots in Chorley) and also, on occasional, let me drop myself off at a more convenient spot if I was meeting friends. I even was in an accident before I passed and Andy was so understanding that I had to take time off to heal from my injuries (I was NOT in his car at the time) and is more or less fully responsible for giving me my confidence back afterwards. Thanks very much Andy!"
