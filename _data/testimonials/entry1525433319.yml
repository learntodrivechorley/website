content: "Learning to drive was the biggest thing I wanted to learn. Andy is a brilliant instructor. He’s so patient, an amazing guy and so good at teaching. After taking my theory twice I didn’t know how my test would go. Andy helped me all the way and passed first time. <br />
I would recommend Andy to anyone who wants to learn to drive."
